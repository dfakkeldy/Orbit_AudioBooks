# Changelog

All notable changes to Orbit Audiobooks.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Mini-player control bar (`PlayerControlBar`) on the Timeline tab — appears above the bottom toolbar when a book is loaded, showing artwork, title/chapter metadata, and play/pause. Tap to open the full NowPlaying player.
- Configurable seek forward/backward durations (5–60s), synced between phone and watch.
- Customizable watch button layout presets — drag-and-drop 10-slot (2 pages × 5 actions) configuration from the phone via `PhonePlayerSettingsView`.
- `LayoutPreset` data model (`WatchPreset`, `PhonePreset`) with WatchConnectivity sync and UserDefaults persistence.
- Configurable default playback speed per-book and globally.
- Theme accent color setting.
- Local watch playback timer with independent progress tracking.
- `os.log` migration for structured logging across all targets.
- GitHub Pages marketing site and privacy policy page.
- Timeline freeze mode for EPUB browsing with sync-and-resume anchoring.

### Changed
- Simplified scrubber layout: time labels always below the slider.
- Watch communication reliability improvements and playlist toggle UI polish.
- Artwork handling simplified; oversized widget artwork now downsampled via ImageIO instead of discarded.

### Fixed
- Watch skip forward/backward fallback SF Symbols corrected from nonexistent `goforward`/`gobackward` to valid `arrow.clockwise`/`arrow.counterclockwise`.
- Auto-resume after audio interruption when playback was paused.
- Digital crown deadzone to prevent accidental scrubbing on watch.
- Out-of-range crashes and settings view layout crash.
- Security-scoped URL access permissions for EPUB auto-import.
- Destructive file operations in EPUB import replaced with copy-only approach.

## [0.6] — 2026-05-10 (Build 8)

### Added
- Per-book settings overrides (font, volume boost, bookmarks-inline) via `BookSettingsOverrideStore`.
- EPUB import flow with `EPUBImportCoordinator` and auto-import scanner.
- Twitter-style timeline cards with materialized `timeline_item` table (Schema V4).
- `TimelineDisplayItem` enum for unified heterogeneous feed rendering (audiobook cards, timeline items, NowLine, scrubber gaps).
- Dual-path timeline ingestion: rich (EPUB + transcription) and sparse (audio-only chapters).
- `MediaPlayable` protocol for forward-looking video support.
- Playlist manifest (`.orbitplaylist.json`) for portable playlist state.

### Changed
- **PlayerModel decomposed** from ~2,900-line god class into a thin coordinator (~1,200 lines) wiring 20+ focused services: `PlaybackController`, `PlaybackState`, `BookmarkStore`, `SleepTimerManager`, `NowPlayingController`, `ChapterLoadingCoordinator`, `PlaybackProgressPresenter`, `PlayerLoadingCoordinator`, `BookmarkArtworkCoordinator`, `PlayerTimelinePersistenceService`, `InlineFlashcardTriggerController`, `EPUBImportCoordinator`, `BookSettingsOverrideStore`, `BookPreferencesService`, `WatchStateContextBuilder`, `WatchCommandRouter`, `PlaylistManager`, `PlaylistManifestService`, `Persistence`, `SecurityScopeManager`, `TranscriptService`.
- **Strict 2-tab UI**: NowPlayingTab (pure media consumption) + TimelineTab (unified library, feed, planner, review).
- NowPlaying layout redesigned with top toolbar and compact scrubber.
- Timeline feed rebuilt as hierarchical, speed-aware scroll with structural zoom (Library → Chapter → Transcription).

### Fixed
- Timeline ingestion pipeline now always fires regardless of chapter count.
- Swift 6 concurrency errors and deprecation warnings resolved.
- Infinite duration on chapters without chapter markers fixed.
- `@MainActor` isolation on `Observable` classes to prevent data races.
- SQLite `DEFAULT` syntax and in-memory test database configuration.
- Anki flashcard: generation counter to prevent stale SnippetPlayer completion races.
- Database: composite indexes on `audiobook_id` columns for query performance.
- Database: UTC ISO8601 date serialization for bookmarks and flashcards.

- **V5 Schema**: `epub_block` and `alignment_anchor` tables for EPUB-audio alignment.
- **EPUB-Audio Alignment Pipeline** (`Tools/OrbitTranscriptionCLI/`): Swift CLI with `transcribe` and `align` subcommands. Includes `OrbitEPUBAligner` library with EPUB parsing, XHTML marker extraction, sliding-window NLP alignment, and marker injection.
- **Anki Spaced Repetition**: Inline flashcard recall during playback, daily review UI with SM-2 grading, snippet media playback (`SnippetPlayer`), JSON deck import, and watchOS hands-free review.
- **CarPlay** support with `CarPlaySceneDelegate`, browse template, and remote commands.
- Multi-file M4B folder support with aggregated chapters.
- Tab navigation: `RootTabView` with `NowPlayingTab` and `TimelineTab`.

- Accessibility labels, values, and Dynamic Type support across iOS, macOS, and watchOS.
- Siri App Intents for dictated bookmarks.

- Watch app redesigned with immersive full-screen artwork and configurable layout.
- Classic watch background setting preserved as toggle.
- Settings centralized in `SettingsManager` with protocol-based mock support.

### Fixed

- Circular ring animation lock-up on background wake.
- Chapter-looping cascade and first-open silence resolved.
- 1× speed dead-zone eliminated.
- `AVAudioUnitVarispeed` replaced with `AVAudioUnitTimePitch` to preserve pitch at >1×.
- Security-scoped access lifetime extended across folder scan and image load.
- Optimistic state updates with rollback on Watch for reliability.
