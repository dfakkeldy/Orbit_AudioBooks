# Changelog

All notable changes to Echo: Audiobook Study Player.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **PDF companion document support:** Import PDF files alongside audiobooks for page-level alignment and bookmarking. `PDFDocumentView` wraps `PDFKit.PDFView` with auto-scale, continuous vertical scroll, and long-press context menus for alignment. `PDFViewState` (page index, zoom, scroll offset) persists in bookmarks via `pdf_view_state_json` column (Schema V11). `PDFImportCoordinator` handles security-scoped file copy with same-folder no-op prevention. PDF bookmark screenshots render the current page to JPEG for thumbnail images.
- **Manual alignment with scrubber joystick:** `ManualAlignmentSheet` provides fine-tuned alignment with play/pause, ±5s skip, and a `ScrubberJoystick` — a horizontal drag-track control with spring-return and exponential mapping (small pulls = slow, big pulls = fast) for precise scrubbing. Audio snippet preview plays during scrub for real-time feedback.
- **Hierarchical chapter titles:** `PlaylistView.computeHierarchicalTitles(for:)` detects parent-child relationships between consecutive chapter titles via prefix matching, formatting nested chapters with leading dots (e.g., "Part 1", ".Chapter 1", "..Section A") for visually scannable playlist hierarchies.
- **Reader tab three-level header:** Sticky reader header now displays Part → Chapter → Section hierarchy. When a part title exists, the chapter title renders smaller and in secondary color, creating visual depth. `ReaderFeedCollectionView` receives a `$topPartTitle` binding alongside existing title bindings.
- **Watch title scroll speed setting:** `watchTitleScrollSpeed` (Double, defaults to 30.0) controls the pixels-per-second scrolling rate for long titles in the watch player, configurable in `WatchAppSettingsView`.
- **Schema V11:** `pdf_view_state_json` (TEXT) columns added to `bookmark` and `timeline_item` tables for PDF view state persistence.
- **Proportional word-count alignment (Schema V8):** `word_count` column on `epub_block` enables alignment interpolation weighted by paragraph content length rather than raw sequence index. Longer paragraphs get proportionally wider time ranges; shorter ones are more tightly positioned. Improves accuracy for chapters with uneven prose/dialogue mixing.
- **Anchor management:** "Erase Anchor" removes a single locked anchor from a block; "Reset Alignment" clears all anchors for the current audiobook. Both trigger timeline recalculation. Available via context menu on locked-anchor cards in both the Reader and Timeline feeds.
- **Reader-specific bottom toolbar:** When the Read tab is active, `BottomToolbarView` switches to reader-optimized controls (skip back, play/pause, skip forward, timeline, bookmark) instead of the standard transport layout. Skip durations use configurable seek settings with dynamic SF Symbol naming.
- **Anchor status indicators:** Locked-anchor cards show a green badge — a timestamp label (Reader feed) or 🔗 icon (Timeline feed) — distinguishing manually-aligned items from interpolated/estimated ones.
- **Debug development assets:** Alice in Wonderland EPUB fixture (`aliceinwonderland_1102_librivox/`) under Development Assets, loadable via a `#if DEBUG` "Load Development Assets" button in Settings for instant reader pipeline testing.
- Mini-player control bar (`PlayerControlBar`) on the Timeline tab — appears above the bottom toolbar when a book is loaded, showing artwork, title/chapter metadata, and play/pause. Tap to open the full NowPlaying player.
- Configurable seek forward/backward durations (5–60s), synced between phone and watch.
- **Watch expanded to 5 pages** — up to 25 customizable action slots (5 pages × 5 slots) with per-page configuration and TabView-style page swiping in settings. Empty pages auto-hide on the watch.
- **Phone transport long-press actions** — each of the 5 transport buttons now supports a configurable long-press secondary action (`TransportButton` / `TransportPrimitiveButtonStyle`) with haptic feedback, configurable via a "Tap Actions" / "Long Press" segmented picker in `PhonePlayerSettingsView`.
- Customizable watch button layout presets — drag-and-drop configuration from the phone via `WatchAppSettingsView`.
- `LayoutPreset` data model (`WatchPreset`, `PhonePreset`) with WatchConnectivity sync and UserDefaults persistence. `WatchPreset` supports optional `page3`/`page4`/`page5` fields; `PhonePreset` supports optional `longPressSlots`.
- Configurable default playback speed per-book and globally.
- Theme accent color setting.
- Local watch playback timer with independent progress tracking.
- `os.log` migration for structured logging across all targets.
- GitHub Pages marketing site and privacy policy page.
- Timeline freeze mode for EPUB browsing with sync-and-resume anchoring.
- **Chapter grouping service** (`ChapterGroupingService`): detects and collapses Libation-style sub-section chapter atoms into logical chapters. Handles patterns like "Chapter 11. A" / "Chapter 11. B" → single "Chapter 11" spanning the full time range, with original sub-sections retained for scrubber tick marks.
- **Section navigation**: new `.nextSection` and `.previousSection` `WatchAction` cases for skipping between sub-section boundaries within chapters. Available on both phone transport controls and watch button layouts.
- **Section scrubber ticks**: `SectionTickOverlay` renders hairline tick marks on the scrubber rail at each sub-section boundary, with magnetic snapping and haptic feedback (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`) while dragging.
- **Compact player layout**: "Compact" layout style option in player settings, reducing transport button sizes and placing the scrubber inline between time labels for a minimalist, one-handed-friendly look.
- **Section disclosure groups in playlist**: logical chapters with sub-section data render as expandable `DisclosureGroup` rows, with tappable section rows and now-playing indicators.
- **Artwork-derived accent color theming**: Dynamic accent (tint) color derived from audiobook cover artwork via `DominantColorExtractor` — downsamples to 100×100px, converts to HSL, builds a saturation²-weighted hue histogram with centre-distance biasing, and clamps saturation/lightness for readability. Available as the "Artwork" theme option in Settings (now the default).
- **Accent contrast safety pipeline**: Two-stage safety net ensuring artwork-derived accent colors are legible against the player surface. `ColorMetrics.isLegible(_:on:)` uses a dual-gate trigger (WCAG luminance ≥ 2.4:1 AND CIELAB ΔE chroma ≥ 52). `AccentSafetyNet.resolve(...)` applies a progressive A→B→C rescue ladder: (A) nudge hue lightness to contrast floor within distortion budget, (B) re-pick next safe cover hue, (C) fall back to nudged brand tint. Returns a `Tier` for debug/telemetry. Key types: `ColorMetrics` (WCAG/CIELAB/HSL/`RGB`), `AccentSafetyNet` (A→B→C rescue), `ArtworkPalette` (`{ rawAccent, candidates, background }`).
- **Shared extractPalette histogram pass**: `DominantColorExtractor.extractPalette(from:)` returns `{ rawAccent, candidates, background }` from a single downsampled histogram scan, shared by accent extraction (`artworkAccentColor`) and background gradient computation.
- **Now Playing UI redesign**: Unified dock/header component architecture (`UnifiedTopHeader`, `UnifiedBottomDock`) with adaptive theming, full-bleed artwork split layout, and tab-specific content padding. Player layout supports Default and Compact styles with configurable transport button sizes.
- **Pomodoro timer**: Focus timer with hours support, multi-wheel picker (hours/minutes/seconds), thicker circular progress indicator with dynamic formatting, wrist-down tick fix, and 3-second persistent alarm. Available as a watch action with artwork accent color syncing.
- **Fullscreen cover art viewer**: Tap album art on watch to view fullscreen cover art.
- **Watch face date overlay**: Configurable date overlay on watch player screen with format options (e.g., "Tue, Jun 9").

### Changed
- **Proportional fallback chapter alignment:** `AutoAlignmentService` now calculates estimated fallback timestamps for EPUB chapters proportionally based on cumulative `word_count` instead of a linear sequence index. A block with 500 words is appropriately weighted against a block with 5 words.
- **DTW Memory Optimization:** Reduced `TokenDTW.align` peak memory consumption by over 80% (from ~125MB to ~25MB for large chapters) by utilizing a sliding 2-row algorithm for Dynamic Time Warping instead of a full NxM cost matrix. Prevents out-of-memory crashes during WhisperKit transcription.
- **Playlist document import unified:** The "Import EPUB" button now accepts both EPUB and PDF files, with automatic routing to the appropriate importer. The Reader tab falls back from EPUB to PDF to empty state based on available companion documents.
- **Reader tab routing:** `RootTabView` now checks `model.hasPDF` when `model.hasEPUB` is false, routing to `PDFDocumentView` instead of `ReaderEmptyState`.
- **Alignment interpolation now uses word-count-weighted proportional math** (Schema V8) instead of sequence-index-based linear interpolation. Results in more accurate timestamp estimates for paragraphs of varying lengths.
- Settings, Book Settings, and Help toolbar buttons consolidated into a single "More" (`ellipsis.circle`) menu on both the NowPlaying tab and the NowPlaying top toolbar.
- Simplified scrubber layout: time labels always below the slider.
- Watch communication reliability improvements and playlist toggle UI polish.
- Artwork handling simplified; oversized widget artwork now downsampled via ImageIO instead of discarded.
- Timeline feed action buttons (bookmark, flashcard, etc.) now use `UIButton.Configuration` with larger content insets for improved hit targets while maintaining 14pt icon size.
- **Watch connectivity architecture overhauled**: Significant state now syncs via durable `updateApplicationContext` (delivered immediately to active watch, guaranteed on next activation), with `sendMessage` retained only as a low-latency optimisation. Transport commands never ride the `transferUserInfo` background queue to prevent stale command replay. High-frequency progress and sleep-timer ticks stay live-only (`reason: .progress`).
- **Swift Concurrency & Thread Safety modernized**: `MainActor.assumeIsolated` replaces `Task { @MainActor in }` for callbacks guaranteed on the main thread across 9 service files. `AVAudioEngine`, `Timer`, and `NSObjectProtocol` observer properties annotated `nonisolated(unsafe)` to suppress Swift 6 data-race diagnostics. `@preconcurrency import AVFoundation` added project-wide.
- **AlignmentService word-position calculation**: Hidden blocks and image blocks now receive weight 0.0 in cumulative word-position computation. Block positions shifted from center to start positioning for more predictable interpolation.

### Fixed
- Watch skip forward/backward fallback SF Symbols corrected from nonexistent `goforward`/`gobackward` to valid `arrow.clockwise`/`arrow.counterclockwise`.
- Auto-resume after audio interruption when playback was paused.
- Digital crown deadzone to prevent accidental scrubbing on watch.
- Out-of-range crashes and settings view layout crash.
- Security-scoped URL access permissions for EPUB auto-import.
- Destructive file operations in EPUB import replaced with copy-only approach.
- EPUB heading hierarchy bug where explicit HTML header tags (e.g., `<h1>`) on sub-sections incorrectly overwrote active chapter and part context.
- **Pause on output device disconnect**: `AudioEngine` now observes `AVAudioSession.routeChangeNotification` and pauses on `.oldDeviceUnavailable` (wired headphones / aux / Bluetooth removed). Previously, `AVAudioEngine` would fall back to the built-in speaker and keep rendering when the cable was pulled.
- **Progress save before track change**: `PlayerLoadingCoordinator` now persists the previous book's last-known-good position under the correct folder key before `stop()` zeroes `audioEngine.currentTime` and `state.folderURL` changes.
- **EPUB auto-import security scope**: When a single file (not a folder) is opened directly, a temporary security-scoped resource access is started on the parent directory so sibling EPUB files can be enumerated.
- **Security scope URL reuse**: `SecurityScopeManager.startSelection(url:)` and `startFile(url:)` now correctly stop the previous access grant when the URL changes (previously `guard !hasAccess` early-exited, leaking the old grant).
- **TokenDTW gap-cost initialization**: DTW cost matrix boundary row and column now initialized with cumulative gap costs so the DP can correctly skip leading tokens with no match in the other sequence.
- **EPUB TOC fallback and chapter index off-by-one**: EPUB table of contents now falls back gracefully when heading hierarchy is incomplete; chapter index corrected for sticky header display.
- **Watch stale transport commands**: Transport commands (play/pause/seek) no longer ride the `transferUserInfo` persistent FIFO queue, preventing phantom resume-after-pause and position jumps on relaunch. Queued payloads are routed through `WatchCommandRouter.route(queuedMessage:)` which honors only deferred-safe commands.
- **Watch timer suspension cap**: When the watch wakes from sleep, `Timer.scheduledTimer` delta is capped at 2.0 seconds — beyond that, the watch requests fresh authoritative state from the phone instead of animating through accumulated progress.
- **Watch stale userInfo handling**: After applying received `userInfo` state, the watch immediately requests the phone's current state to converge to the authoritative position.
