## 1. Positioning

**One-liner:** Echo is the audiobook player that helps you *remember* what you heard.

**Longer:** Every other audiobook app is built for passive listening — play, pause, fall asleep. Echo is built for learning: chapter looping, smart rewind, voice and photo bookmarks, a synced EPUB/PDF reader, and a built-in spaced-repetition study system, all designed around interrupted attention and backed by memory science.

### The audience question ("is it too focused on the neurodivergent?")

The answer is the **curb-cut effect**: curb cuts were designed for wheelchairs, but they help everyone pushing a stroller, pulling luggage, or riding a bike. Echo was designed for an AuDHD brain with an interrupted workday — and that design produces a better tool for *every* listener whose attention is interrupted, which is to say, every listener.

So the positioning is layered, not narrowed:

| Layer | Audience | Message |
|---|---|---|
| Core story | Neurodivergent learners (ADHD, AuDHD, dyslexia) | "Finally, an app that works the way your brain works." |
| Broad benefit | Students, professionals, lifelong learners | "Stop forgetting your audiobooks. Turn listening into knowledge." |
| Situational | Commuters, drivers, parents, tradespeople | "Built by a mail carrier who's in and out of the car 30 times a day. It survives interruption." |
| Niche-technical | DRM-free / Libation / LibriVox / Anki users | "The serious player for your DRM-free library. Anki, but audio-first." |

**Rule of thumb:** lead every surface with the *universal benefit* (remember what you hear), support it with the *neurodivergent-first origin* (credibility + differentiation), and close with the *technical depth* (alignment, SRS, watch) for the people who evaluate features.

### How much of Dan's story to include

All of it — it is the single most differentiating asset Echo has. A 47-year-old mail carrier with no formal CS background, facing a layoff, who built a four-platform Apple app in two months because no app on the internet would loop a chapter — that is a story tech press, Reddit, and Apple editorial all respond to. People root for it, and it *proves* the app's thesis: it was built inside the exact interruption-heavy life it serves.

Where it appears, scaled to the surface:
- **Website:** full story section + link to the devlog ("watch it being built, week by week").
- **App Store description:** 3–4 sentence condensed origin story (already in place).
- **Press/Reddit pitches:** the story IS the pitch; the app is the proof.
- **Devlog:** the story in commit form — radical transparency, great for Hacker News.

## 2. What goes where

### Two web surfaces

Echo has two sites with distinct jobs:

- **kinnokilabs.com** (+ kinnokilabs.ca) — the *company* site and canonical product pages. App Store `marketing_url` → `/apps/echo`; `support_url` → `/echo-help` (real FAQs + email contact). Echo docs live at `/echo-learn`, `/echo-manual`, `/echo-devlog`, `/echo-beta`. Built with Swift Publish; `make publish` in `~/Developer/KinNoKiLabsSite` regenerates, commits, and pushes — Cloudflare Pages deploys on push.
- **dfakkeldy.github.io/Echo** — the *project* site for the open-source audience (GitHub Pages from `main:/docs`). Same content suite, OpenDyslexic-branded design. Linked from the README; the natural landing for Show HN / r/iOSProgramming traffic.

Content changes should land on both; kinnokilabs.com is the one App Store users see.

### Website content — the *why*

The website carries everything that needs room to breathe:

- **Home (`index.html`)** — hero promise, the story, feature grid organized by benefit, the science teaser, platform lineup, open-source + privacy trust signals, CTA (beta access).
- **Learn (`learn.html`)** — "Getting the Most Out of Echo": every feature explained alongside the memory science that makes it work. This doubles as shareable evergreen content — it earns links and Reddit posts on its own ("why taking a photo helps you remember an audiobook").
- **Manual (`manual.html`)** — the complete user manual. Reference depth; also a sales tool for feature-evaluators.
- **Devlog (`devlog.html`)** — weekly build summaries from the actual commit history. Build-in-public artifact and press kit in one.
- **Beta (`beta.html`)** — the TestFlight funnel: how to join, how to send useful feedback, six structured test plans, known limitations, beta privacy. Every "join the beta" CTA on the site lands here; when the public TestFlight link exists, it goes at the top of this page (one URL to update).
- **Privacy (`privacy.html`)** — short, absolute, plain language. Privacy is a feature.

### App Store listing — the *what*, in 10 seconds

- **Name (30 chars):** `Echo: Audiobook Study Player`
- **Subtitle (30 chars):** `For Every Mind`
- **Promotional text (170 chars):** rotating hook; updates without review. Lead with the newest benefit.
- **Description:** benefit-first bullets, condensed origin story, accessibility section. *Only shipped features* — App Review Guideline 2.3.1 requires metadata accuracy, so vision-stage features stay on the website until they ship.
- **Keywords (100 chars):** prioritize phrases users actually search: `audiobook, study, ADHD, anki, flashcards, epub, dyslexia, loop, bookmark, m4b, drm-free, speed`.
- **Screenshots:** demonstrate the study workflow in ≤10 seconds of scanning: ① player with photo bookmark, ② synced reader following the narration, ③ flashcard review, ④ watch remote, ⑤ "all on-device" privacy frame. Caption every screenshot with a benefit, not a feature name.
- **What's New:** every release, written like the devlog — humans read these.

### Channels beyond the website/App Store

| Channel | Play | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **TestFlight public link** | Beta funnel from all channels | All CTAs route through `beta.html` (tester guide + test plans); beta copy is version-controlled in `fastlane/testflight/` and ships with `fastlane beta`; beta testers become launch-day reviewers |
| **Show HN / Hacker News** | "Show HN: I deliver mail; I built an audiobook player that helps you remember books" | Open source + story + on-device ML = HN catnip. Link repo, not landing page |
| **Reddit** | Value-first posts, never ads | r/audiobooks (DRM-free workflow), r/ADHD + r/AuDHD (the science guide, asked-for-advice tone), r/Anki ("audio-first SRS"), r/iOSProgramming + r/SwiftUI (devlog/how-it's-built), r/libation + r/audible (mp3/m4b workflow) |
| **Apple editorial pitch** | App Store "Behind the App" / accessibility stories | Apple actively features accessibility-first indie apps; pitch via App Store Connect promotional request around launch + Global Accessibility Awareness Day (May) |
| **Tech press** | MacStories, 9to5Mac, Daring Fireball, The Verge "Installer" | Pitch the human story + 60-second demo video; MacStories loves indie + accessibility + open source |
| **YouTube/Shorts** | 30–60s demos: photo bookmark → artwork switch; auto-align an EPUB; watch-only workflow | Screen recordings are cheap to make and demo features words can't |
| **Anki/SRS community** | Blog post: "What Anki gets right, and what audio changes" | Position as *complement*, not replacement — deck import exists |
| **Open-source community** | GitHub README as landing page, good-first-issues, MIT license | Stars are social proof; contributors are evangelists |
| **Podcasts** | Indie dev shows (Under the Radar audience), ADHD podcasts | The origin story carries a 30-minute conversation easily |

### Launch sequence

1. **Now → beta:** publish website + devlog, TestFlight public link, soft posts in r/audiobooks + r/libation. Collect testimonials.
2. **App Store launch:** press pitches out 2 weeks prior, Show HN on launch day, Reddit value-posts staggered over launch week, Apple editorial request filed.
3. **Post-launch:** devlog continues weekly (retention + SEO), science-guide excerpts as standalone posts, App Store promotional text rotated with each release.

## 3. Messaging bank

Approved phrases — keep voice consistent everywhere:

- "Turn listening into learning."
- "The audiobook player that helps you remember."
- "Built for interrupted attention." / "It survives interruption."
- "Anki for your ears." (community surfaces only — assumes Anki familiarity)
- "Your brain already remembers *where* you were. Echo uses that."
- "No cloud. No tracking. Your books, your data, your device."
- "Designed for AuDHD brains. Better for every brain." (the curb-cut line)
- "For Every Mind." (official subtitle)

Words to avoid: "revolutionary", "AI-powered" (it's on-device ML — say *that*, it's more credible), "hack your brain", any medical claims ("treats ADHD" — never).

## 4. Measurement

Keep it lightweight and privacy-consistent (no analytics in-app, ever):

- GitHub stars / traffic graphs (free, built-in)
- TestFlight tester count + crash-free rate
- App Store Connect impressions → product page views → downloads funnel
- App Store keyword rankings (check manually monthly)
- Devlog/manual page views via GitHub Pages traffic insights

---

## 5. Honesty ledger (internal)

The website and manual describe the complete product vision in present tense (per docs policy). Features documented ahead of shipping are tracked here so App Store metadata never overclaims:

| Feature | Docs | Shipped? |
|---|---|---|
| Photo bookmarks + artwork switching | Manual, Learn, site | ✅ Shipped (`bookmarkImageFileName`, `BookmarkArtworkCoordinator`) |
| SM-2 flashcards, daily review, watch review, deck import | Everywhere | ✅ Shipped |
| 3-tier auto-alignment (WhisperKit/TokenDTW) | Everywhere | ✅ Shipped |
| PDF companion + manual alignment joystick | Everywhere | ✅ Shipped |
| **Chapter Study Mode** (chapter-as-Anki-card, study playlist) | Manual, Learn, site | 🔶 Vision — keep out of App Store copy until shipped |
| **Location snapshot bookmarks** (Maps thumbnail) | Site "what's next" only | 🔶 Vision |
| iCloud study-state sync | Manual (basic), site | 🔶 Partial (anchors only) — phrase carefully |

When a 🔶 item ships: move it into App Store description + What's New, announce in devlog, delete the row.
