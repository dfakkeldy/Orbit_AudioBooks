            Tap the folder icon in the top-left corner to open the file picker. You can select a single audio file or an entire folder.

            Supported formats: MP3, M4A, and M4B.

            When you select a folder, all supported audio files inside are added to your playlist in alphabetical order. Chapter markers embedded in M4B and M4A files are automatically detected and used for chapter navigation.

            Artwork is discovered automatically — the app looks for embedded cover art, then for an image file named "cover" (any image format) in the same folder. If nothing is found, the app icon is used as a fallback.

            If a .transcript.json file with the same name as your audio file is in the same folder, it is loaded automatically and available as a scrolling transcript overlay.

            Your last opened book is restored automatically when you relaunch the app.

            **Keeping files available offline:** Files stored in iCloud Drive or other cloud services may be automatically removed from your device to free up space. To ensure your audiobooks are always available:

            • In the Files app, long-press the folder containing your audiobooks and select "Keep Downloaded." This pins the files to your device so they never get evicted.
            • For the most reliable experience, store your audiobooks in an "On My iPhone" / "On My iPad" folder rather than iCloud Drive. These folders are always local and never subject to cloud eviction.

            If you open Echo and your book doesn't resume, check that your files are still downloaded in the Files app.

            Bookmarks let you save and annotate specific moments in your audiobook.

            Creating a bookmark: Tap the bookmark icon in the bottom toolbar while playing. This captures the current timestamp and opens the bookmark editor.

            Editing a bookmark: You can give it a title, adjust the timestamp with +/- 1 second buttons, add a text note, attach a photo from your library (picture bookmark), or record a voice memo.

            Picture bookmarks: When playback passes a bookmark with an attached image, that image temporarily replaces the album artwork on the player screen.

            Voice memos: Record audio notes attached to bookmarks. When "Play Bookmarks Inline" is enabled in Settings, voice memos play automatically as the audiobook reaches each bookmark's timestamp. During voice memo playback, the main player dims and a "Playing Voice Memo" badge appears.

            Bookmarks are stored as a portable .json file alongside your audiobook files. You can export bookmarks to Markdown — the exported file includes clickable links that open the audiobook at the exact timestamp.

            If you add an EPUB file alongside your audiobook (in the same folder, with the same name), the Reader tab becomes available. This turns your audiobook into a fully searchable, browsable book.

            **Automatic alignment:** When you first open an EPUB, the app automatically aligns each chapter to the corresponding audio chapter. Paragraphs are spaced proportionally within each chapter based on their word count — longer paragraphs get wider time ranges for more accurate estimates.

            **Auto-Align Chapters:** Long-press any card and choose "Auto-Align Chapters" to run the full 3-tier alignment pipeline using on-device speech recognition (WhisperKit + CoreML):

            • Tier 1 — Chapter Snap: The app transcribes short audio clips at each chapter boundary and fuzzy-matches the recognized text against your EPUB to anchor chapter start/end positions.
            • Tier 2 — Drift Detection: Each chapter's interpolated block positions are compared against the boundaries to flag chapters that have drifted out of alignment.
            • Tier 3 — Drift Repair: For misaligned chapters, TokenDTW (Dynamic Time Warping) aligns transcribed audio tokens against EPUB tokens at word-level precision and inserts correction anchors at the best-matching positions.

            A live log shows every match attempt so you can see exactly what's happening. Best run when you have a few minutes — it processes each chapter sequentially.

            **Manual alignment:** Long-press any paragraph card and choose "Align to Now" to lock that paragraph to the current playback position. This makes the alignment exact. The more paragraphs you lock, the more precise the alignment becomes. You can also use "Align to Chapter Start/End" on heading cards to match them to specific chapter boundaries. Locked-anchor cards show a green badge with the anchored timestamp.

            **Anchor management:** Long-press a locked-anchor card and choose "Erase Anchor" to remove a single anchor, or "Reset Alignment" to clear all anchors for the current book. Both automatically recalculate surrounding timestamps based on remaining anchors.

            **Search:** Pull down or tap the header to reveal the search bar. Type any phrase to instantly filter the entire book to matching paragraphs. Matching words are highlighted in yellow.

            **Table of Contents:** Tap the list icon in the reader header to browse the book's full table of contents. Tap any entry to jump to that section.

            **Auto-scroll:** The reader can follow playback automatically. When auto-scroll is on, the current paragraph highlights with a blue bar and the view scrolls to keep it centered. Scroll manually to pause auto-follow; tap the scroll-to-active button (↓) in the header to re-enable it.

            **Reader toolbar:** When the Reader tab is active, the bottom toolbar switches to reader-optimized controls: skip back, play/pause, skip forward (with your configured seek durations), timeline, and bookmark. This keeps essential playback controls at your fingertips while reading.

            **Card colors:** Long-press any card and choose "Change Color" to highlight it. Use this to color-code important passages, mark sections to revisit, or organize your study notes.

            **Bookmarks from text:** Long-press a paragraph and choose "Save Bookmark" to create a timestamped bookmark linked to that text. The bookmark's note is pre-filled with the first 200 characters of the paragraph.

            **Copy text:** Long-press and choose "Copy Text" to copy the paragraph to your clipboard.

            **Inline formatting & markers:** The reader preserves bold, italic, and underline formatting from the EPUB. Images, hyperlinks, blockquotes, and horizontal rules are detected and displayed in the reading feed.

            **Reader settings:** Tap the font size icon in the header to adjust font size, line spacing, and the default card background tint.
