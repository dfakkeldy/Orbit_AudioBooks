**Echo** turns audiobooks into a serious study medium. Search across spoken content, jump to any passage, create flashcards from what you hear, and review with spaced repetition — all without leaving the audio.

Echo is built for **every kind of mind.** For neurodivergent learners (including the AuDHD community), Echo bridges the gap between reading and listening: a synced EPUB sits alongside your audiobook so you can follow the text while you hear it, jump between the two, and never lose your place. If you've ever struggled to stay focused on audio alone — or found that reading is your anchor — this hybrid approach is for you. Built for students, professionals, and anyone who learns differently.

## The Study Workflow

Echo is built around a simple idea: **audiobooks should be as searchable and referenceable as textbooks.** Here's how that works:

```
Add audiobook + EPUB   →   Echo aligns text to audio
          ↓
Search for any phrase   →   Jump instantly to that moment in the narration
          ↓
Lock paragraphs to timestamps   →   Build a precise, verified map of the book
          ↓
Create bookmarks & flashcards   →   Capture knowledge while you listen
          ↓
Review with spaced repetition   →   Retain what you learned, on your schedule
```

### Why This Matters

- **Find anything, instantly.** Heard a great passage but can't remember where? Type a few words — Echo finds it in the EPUB and seeks the audio to that exact moment.
- **Study while you listen.** Long-press any paragraph to align it to the current playback position, color-code important passages, or create timestamped bookmarks and flashcards.
- **Retain more.** Echo's built-in spaced repetition system (SM-2 algorithm) schedules flashcards for optimal retention — review on your phone or Apple Watch during idle moments.
- **Learn hands-free.** The customizable Apple Watch app lets you control playback, create bookmarks, and review flashcards between deliveries, during commutes, or while working out.
- **Designed for neurodiversity.** Lexend and OpenDyslexic fonts — both backed by reading-fluency research — are built in. The hybrid EPUB+audio view means you're never forced to learn by listening alone. The app icon (an infinity symbol in silver and gold) is a nod to the AuDHD community.

## Overview

Echo is a full-featured audiobook study application organized as a single Xcode workspace with four distinct targets. It supports bookmarking with optional voice memos, chapter navigation, loop modes, a sleep timer, variable playback speed, and intelligent rewind logic that adapts to pause duration. The iOS and watchOS apps communicate bidirectionally via WatchConnectivity, while a Widget displays the current playback state on the Home Screen / Lock Screen.

When you add an EPUB file alongside your audiobook, Echo unlocks its study toolkit: a searchable, browsable reader with per-paragraph audio alignment. Long-press any paragraph to lock it to the current playback position, color-code important passages, or create timestamped bookmarks. Use **Auto-Align Chapters** to let on-device speech recognition (WhisperKit + CoreML) automatically align every chapter — it maps silence gaps to chapter boundaries (Tier 0), transcribes short clips at chapter starts, fuzzy-matches them against the EPUB text (Levenshtein + Jaccard), and creates precise alignment anchors. A drift-detection system finds and repairs misaligned chapters. Optional **Continuous Alignment** runs in the background during playback.

---

## Architecture

The workspace is composed of four targets, each with its own entry point and view hierarchy:

| Target | Bundle Identifier / Entry Point | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **EchoCore** (`iOS/iPadOS`) | `Echo_AudioBooksApp.swift` → `RootTabView.swift` | Primary audiobook player. Uses a 3-tab layout (NowPlayingTab, ReaderTab with EPUB alignment and full-text search, PlaylistTab). PlayerModel acts as a thin coordinator over 20+ single-responsibility services. Handles file/folder selection, bookmarks, voice memos, WatchConnectivity, and Now Playing integration. When an EPUB file is loaded alongside the audiobook, the Reader tab provides a searchable, browsable book with per-paragraph audio alignment. |
| **Echo: Audiobook Study Player macOS** (`macOS`) | `Echo_Audiobooks_macOSApp.swift` → `MacContentView.swift` | Native macOS desktop companion. Uses `MacPlayerModel` (`@Observable`-based) with a `NavigationSplitView` layout: a bookmarks sidebar, a player pane with transport controls and a speed picker, and EPUB alignment via `MacGlobalAlignmentService` with streaming audio transcription support. |
| **Echo: Audiobook Study Player Watch App** (`watchOS`) | `EchoCoreWatchApp.swift` → `ContentView.swift` | Wearable remote for the iOS player. Communicates with the phone via `WCSession` to send play/pause, skip, scrub, volume, loop mode, sleep timer, section navigation, and bookmark commands. Features a customizable button layout with up to five pages of five action slots each (25 total), with configurable seek forward/backward durations (5–60s), all syncable from the phone. |
| **Echo: Audiobook Study Player Widget** (`Widgets`) | `Echo_Audiobooks_WidgetBundle.swift` → `Echo_Audiobooks_Widget.swift` | A `WidgetBundle` exposing a `StaticConfiguration` widget (`.accessoryCircular`) that shows the current track title, progress ring, and thumbnail via `AppGroupDefaults` communication. Also includes a `TogglePlaybackIntent` (App Intent) for Control Center / widget interactions. |

Shared models and utilities used across targets include:

- **`PlayerModel`** — Central iOS/iPadOS coordinator (`@Observable`), wires together 20+ focused services (PlaybackController, BookmarkStore, SleepTimerManager, ChapterLoadingCoordinator, PlaybackProgressPresenter, PlayerLoadingCoordinator, BookmarkArtworkCoordinator, PlayerTimelinePersistenceService, PlaylistManager, ChapterGroupingService, etc.) via closure injection in `init()`. Each service owns a single responsibility; PlayerModel provides thin pass-through computed properties for SwiftUI view binding. Supports section-level navigation within chapters (Libation-style sub-sections), a compact player layout mode, and haptic-scrubbing through section tick marks on the scrubber rail.
- **`MacPlayerModel`** — macOS-specific playback model wrapping AVPlayer with its own bookmark format (`MacBookmark`), security-scoped bookmarks, and UserDefaults persistence.
- **`Bookmark.swift`** — The `Bookmark` struct (Codable, Equatable, Hashable) representing a saved position, with optional text note and voice memo filename. Includes `VoiceMemoRecorder` and `EditBookmarkView` for recording/editing.
- **`AppIntent.swift`** — Shared `AppGroupDefaults` suite and `SessionDelegator` for WCSession activation, enabling the widget and app intents to toggle playback.
- **`LayoutPreset.swift`** — `WatchPreset` and `PhonePreset` data models (Codable, Identifiable) for customizable watch button layouts (up to 5 pages × 5 slots) and phone transport control layouts (5-slot tap actions + 5-slot long-press secondary actions). The action palette includes play/pause, skip, next/previous track, next/previous section, loop mode, speed, sleep timer, and bookmark. Presets sync bidirectionally via WatchConnectivity and persist in UserDefaults.
- **`WatchAction.swift`** — Enumeration of all available transport actions (`playPause`, `skipForward`, `skipBackward`, `nextTrack`, `previousTrack`, `nextSection`, `previousSection`, `loopMode`, `speed`, `sleepTimer`, `bookmark`, `empty`) with SF Symbol icon mappings and watch command routing strings.
- **`ChapterGroupingService.swift`** — Detects and collapses Libation-style sub-section chapter atoms (e.g. "Chapter 11. A" / "Chapter 11. B") into logical chapters, retaining sub-sections for scrubber tick marks and section-level navigation.
- **Shared Font Assets** — `Lexend.ttf` and `OpenDyslexic-Regular.otf` are bundled in both the iOS and macOS targets for accessibility-optimized typography.
	- **`ReaderFeedViewModel`** — View model for the EPUB reader feed. Loads blocks from `EPubBlockDAO`, supports full-text search, and tracks the active block via binary search for O(log N) playback sync.
	- **`ReaderCardItem`** — Enum for reader feed items (`.chapterHeader` and `.block(EPubBlockRecord)`), rendered as cards in a `UICollectionView`.
	- **`ReaderSettings`** — User-configurable reader settings: font size, line spacing, and card background tint color.
	- **`AlignmentService`** — Manual EPUB-to-audio alignment through locked anchors and word-count-weighted proportional interpolation with dynamic CPS projection.
	- **`AutoAlignmentService`** — On-device WhisperKit-based auto-alignment: silence mapping (Tier 0), chapter snap (Tier 1), drift detection (Tier 2), drift repair (Tier 3), and manual fine-tuning.
	- **`AutoAlignmentTextMatcher`** — Fuzzy text matching (Levenshtein + word-level Jaccard) for matching transcribed audio against EPUB paragraphs.
	- **`SilenceDetectionService`** — AVAudioFile + Accelerate-based silence gap detection for chapter boundary mapping.
	- **`EPUBImportService`** — Parses EPUB files into `epub_block` records: extracts the OPF spine, parses XHTML, copies images to Application Support.
	- **`EPUBXMLParsing`** — Shared EPUB XML parser delegates (`ContainerXMLParser`, `OPFParserDelegate`, `XHTMLBlockDelegate`) deduplicated across iOS and macOS — each platform previously carried ~190 lines of identical parsing code.
	- **`WhisperSession`** — Reference-counted, shared WhisperKit model manager. Prevents duplicate ~40 MB model loads when both `AutoAlignmentService` and `ContinuousAlignmentService` are active.
	- **`ContinuousAlignmentService`** — Background audio capture and transcription: samples 15-second audio windows during playback, transcribes via WhisperKit, and inserts alignment anchors on-the-fly.
	- **`FileLocations`** — Centralized directory access (`documentsDirectory`, `cachesDirectory`, `applicationSupportDirectory`, `epubUnpackedDirectory(safeID:)`) replacing ad-hoc `FileManager.default.urls(for:in:)` calls across the codebase.
	- **`KeychainStore`** — Thin Keychain wrapper for storing security-scoped bookmark data and other sensitive blobs that should not live in unencrypted `UserDefaults`.
	- **`Logger+Subsystem`** — Single `"com.orbitaudiobooks"` subsystem constant used by every logger in the project — prevents log fragmentation from typos in repeated string literals.
	- **`AnimationDurations`** — Named animation timing constants (`.micro`, `.standard`, `.emphasized`, `.slow`) to replace magic-number literals scattered across view bodies.
	- **`AudioSnippetPlayer`** — Lightweight, single-use audio player for voice-memo previews and bookmark playback. Eliminates the ad-hoc `AVAudioEngine` setup duplicated across `BookmarkStore`, `Bookmarks`, and `SnippetPlayer`.

## Accessibility (A11y) First

Echo is built with accessibility as a core principle, not an afterthought.

### Neurodivergent-Friendly Design

Echo is built from the ground up for the AuDHD (Autism + ADHD) and broader neurodivergent community. The core premise — a **hybrid reading + listening** experience — was inspired by the realization that many neurodivergent people struggle to learn from audio alone and need text as an anchor to stay engaged.

### Dyslexia-Optimized Typography

The project bundles two specially-selected font families to support dyslexic and neurodivergent readers:

- **Lexend** ([`EchoCore/Fonts/Lexend.ttf`](EchoCore/Fonts/Lexend.ttf) and [`Echo: Audiobook Study Player macOS/Fonts/Lexend.ttf`](Echo%20Audiobooks%20macOS/Fonts/Lexend.ttf)) — A typeface designed with research-backed letter spacing and proportions to improve reading fluency and reduce visual crowding.
- **OpenDyslexic** ([`EchoCore/Fonts/OpenDyslexic-Regular.otf`](EchoCore/Fonts/OpenDyslexic-Regular.otf) and [`Echo: Audiobook Study Player macOS/Fonts/OpenDyslexic-Regular.otf`](Echo%20Audiobooks%20macOS/Fonts/OpenDyslexic-Regular.otf)) — An open-source font weighted at the bottom to combat letter reversal and rotation, widely adopted by the dyslexia community.

### App Icon & Colors: An AuDHD Shoutout

The Echo app icon features an **infinity symbol (∞) in silver and gold** — a deliberate nod to the AuDHD community:

- **Infinity symbol (∞)**: Widely adopted by the neurodivergent community to represent the infinite variations and possibilities of the human mind — the idea that there is no single "correct" way to think, learn, or process information.
- **Silver & gold**: The AuDHD community's colors, representing the dual nature of autism (Au) and ADHD (DHD), and the unique strengths that come from this combination.
- **"Echo"**: The name itself speaks to the way many AuDHD brains work — ideas echoing back and forth between different modes of thinking, with text and audio reinforcing each other.

### Developer Requirements

> **All developers contributing to this project MUST:**
> 1. Register both fonts in the target's `Info.plist` under `UIAppFonts` (iOS) / `ATSApplicationFontsPath` (macOS) when adding new text-rendering targets.
> 2. Apply `Lexend` as the default body font and `OpenDyslexic` as the dyslexia-friendly toggle option in all user-facing text views.
> 3. Never hardcode a system font (`SF Pro`, `Helvetica Neue`, etc.) as the sole typographic option — the app must always offer at least one of the bundled accessibility fonts.
> 4. Test all new UI with both fonts enabled to ensure no truncation, overlapping, or layout breakage.

### Additional A11y Practices

- AVPlayer is configured with `mode: .spokenAudio` for optimal speech reproduction and language-specific voiceover support.
- All interactive controls (play/pause, skip, seek) are surfaced via `UIAccessibility` and WatchOS `accessibility` modifiers.
- Widget progress rings use high-contrast `.tint` fills and avoid ambiguous color-only state indicators.

## Development & Testing

### Test Suites

| Target | Test File | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **EchoCoreTests** | `EchoCoreTests.swift` | Unit tests for the iOS model layer (playback logic, bookmark persistence, timer logic). |
| **EchoCoreUITests** | `EchoCoreUITests.swift`, `EchoCoreUITestsLaunchTests.swift` | UI integration tests for the iOS app using XCUITest. |
| **Echo: Audiobook Study Player Watch AppTests** | `Echo_Audiobooks_Watch_AppTests.swift` | Unit tests for watchOS model and WCSession command parsing. |
| **Echo: Audiobook Study Player Watch AppUITests** | `Echo_Audiobooks_Watch_AppUITests.swift` | UI tests for the watch app (launch validation, button interaction). |

Run all tests from Xcode with `⌘U` or via the terminal:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -workspace Echo\ Audiobooks.xcodeproj \
  -scheme "Echo: Audiobook Study Player" \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16 Pro'
```

### MockMediaProvider

[`MockMediaProvider.swift`](EchoCore/MockMediaProvider.swift) is a `#if DEBUG`-only utility that seeds a sample audiobook (`BIFF.m4b`) into the simulator's Documents directory on first launch. It is automatically invoked during `DEBUG && targetEnvironment(simulator)` builds in the app's `init()`.

**Usage during development:**
- Add `BIFF.m4b` to the app bundle (e.g., in the `Development Assets` folder).
- The mock provider copies it to the Documents directory on first launch, making it available for selection in the folder picker.
- The provider also supplies `sampleAudiobookURL()` for automatic restoration in `restoreLastSelectionIfPossible()`.

This allows developers to test the full playback, bookmarking, and chapter-navigation pipeline without any network dependency or real audiobook files.

## Agentic Workflows

Echo includes an autonomous agent workflow definition at [`.clinerules/workflows/release.md`](.clinerules/workflows/release.md). This file is consumed by Cline-compatible agents to automate the release process:

1. The agent asks the developer for the next semantic version number.
2. It updates `MARKETING_VERSION` and increments `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in the Xcode project settings.
3. It stages all changes and commits with `chore: bump version to [version]`.
4. It requests permission before pushing to the remote.

When extending or modifying the project with autonomous tooling, future agents MUST:
- Read `.clinerules/workflows/release.md` before executing any version-bump or release-related task.
- Respect the font accessibility constraints documented in the **Accessibility (A11y) First** section above.
- Ensure all four platform targets remain buildable and that platform-specific compilation guards (e.g., `#if os(iOS)`, `#if os(macOS)`, `#if os(watchOS)`) are correctly maintained.
